# Bio

My name is Niclas Richter, a mathematician in training. After my undergraduate degree I have worked as a Data Expert in the field of official statistics. Currently going back to university for graduate studies.

I am passionate about exploring computational methods and utilizing quantitative approaches to solve diverse problems, with expertise in Julia, R, and Python. Generally, I am an inquisitive person, which is why I've named this website *'A Curious Mathematician'*.

I hold a degree (B.Sc.) in Mathematics after studying at TU Dresden and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
