abstract = {Abstract This paper presents some procedures aimed at helping an applied time-series analyst in the use of power transformations. Two methods are proposed for selecting a variance-stabilizing transformation and another for bias-reduction of the forecast in the original scale. Since these methods are essentially model-independent, they can be employed with practically any type of time-series model. Some comparisons are made with other methods currently available and it is shown that those proposed here are either easier to apply or are more general, with a performance similar to or better than other competing procedures.},

 abstract={Automatic forecasts of large numbers of univariate time series are often needed in business and other contexts. We describe two automatic forecasting algorithms that have been implemented in the forecast package for R. The first is based on innovations state space models that underly exponential smoothing methods. The second is a step-wise algorithm for forecasting with ARIMA models. The algorithms are applicable to both seasonal and non-seasonal data, and are compared and illustrated using four real time series. We also briefly describe some of the other functionality available in the forecast package.},
